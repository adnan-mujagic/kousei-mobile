### Kousei / FACEMAPP 
This is a social media website/application which shows users on the map so that they could easily be located (only if they choose the option to be visible of course) as well as enabling instant messaging for the users in order to arrange meetings, or just simply communicate to each other! This project is made using expo in React Native framework, and is primarily intended for use on Android operating systems (no testing was done for iPhones yet and there are probably some adjustments that have to be made beforehand).

#### Prerequisites
In order to run the project locally, just run 

`npm install` if you are using npm or 

`yarn install` if you are using yarn

This project was made using expo so make sure to have expo cli installed locally on your machine!

`npm install --global expo-cli`
